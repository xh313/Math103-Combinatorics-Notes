Galois theory notes made by Xuehuai He based on FA23 MATH172 at Pomona College taught by Prof Ghassan Sarkis based on the textbook _Abstract Algebra, Dummit and Foote_.

Please feel free to read and reference. You might find these less useful if you are not one of my classmates, but still feel free to read.
However, please do not use the notes for other purposes or distribute them anywhere else.

I do not hold copyright, since I am only a student typing everything Prof Sarkis down real-time. I also do not warrant the completeness, accuracy and correctness of this note collection.
Due to the notes being typed in LaTeX real-time in class, there might be a relatively large amount of errors and typos. I would appreciate if you submit an issue if you find one;
also, feel free to open a pull request if you feel like fixing anything or providing an alternative proof. 

The main file is the only `.pdf` file compiled from the `SCRIBE.tex` file.
